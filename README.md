# CS51Final
Final Project for PO CSCI51P: 

I analyzed a data set of 500 movies for different trends in movie production and profitability. Specifically, I addressed three main questions: How has the production cost for movies changed over time? How does a movie’s global profit change across different runtimes? How does a movie’s revenue change across different genres?

Throughout the project, I worked on parsing data from a CSV file, used numpy to generate a scatter plot w/ a line of best fit, bar charts, and box plots.

Note: This was a partner project, but the ratio of code I wrote to code my partner wrote was 80:20.
